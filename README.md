## Customer Churn Predictor
A user-friendly tool that helps telecom companies identify customers at risk of leaving ("churning") so they can take action to keep them.

### Why It Matters
Losing customers hurts business. This app predicts which customers might leave based on their:
- Contract type (monthly, yearly, etc.)
- Internet service details
- How long theyâ€™ve been with the company
- Monthly and total charges
  
With this insight, companies can offer personalized deals, better support, or incentives to retain customers.

### How It Works
1. Enter customer details (contract type, service plan, etc.).
2. The app analyzes the data using smart prediction technology.
3. It shows whether the customer is likely to stay or leave.
4. (Optional) Provide feedback to help improve future predictions.
